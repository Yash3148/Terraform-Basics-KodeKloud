# Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is a method of managing and provisioning computing infrastructure through machine-readable definition files, rather than physical hardware configuration or interactive configuration tools. This approach allows for automation and consistency in setting up environments, which is especially useful in DevOps practices.

## Types of IaC

There are two main types of IaC:

1. **Declarative IaC**: 
   - Focuses on defining the desired state of the infrastructure.
   - You specify what the final environment should look like, and the IaC tool takes care of achieving that state.

2. **Imperative IaC**: 
   - Involves writing code that specifies the exact steps needed to achieve the desired state.
   - Provides more control over the process but can be more complex to manage.

## Types of IaC Tools

1. **Configuration Management**: 
   - Ansible
   - Puppet
   - Saltstack

2. **Server Templating**: 
   - Docker
   - HashiCorp Packer
   - HashiCorp Vagrant

3. **Provisioning Tools**: 
   - HashiCorp Terraform
   - CloudFormation

## Why Terraform?

Terraform is a popular choice for managing infrastructure as code (IaC) for several reasons:

1. **Platform Agnostic**: 
   - Can manage infrastructure across multiple cloud providers like AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud, as well as on-premises environments. This flexibility allows you to use a single tool for all your infrastructure needs.

2. **Declarative Language**: 
   - Uses a declarative language, meaning you define the desired state of your infrastructure, and Terraform handles the steps to achieve that state. This approach simplifies the management of complex environments.

3. **Immutable Infrastructure**: 
   - Promotes the use of immutable infrastructure, where changes are made by replacing resources rather than modifying them in place. This reduces the risk of configuration drift and makes deployments more predictable.

4. **Modular and Reusable Code**: 
   - Supports modules, which are reusable configurations that can be shared and versioned. This helps maintain consistency and reduces duplication in your infrastructure code.

5. **Strong Community and Support**: 
   - Has a large, active community and is backed by HashiCorp, providing extensive documentation, tutorials, and support.

6. **State Management**: 
   - Keeps track of the state of your infrastructure, allowing you to see what changes will be made before applying them. This helps prevent unexpected modifications and ensures that your infrastructure remains consistent.
